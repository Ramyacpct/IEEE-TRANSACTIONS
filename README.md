The repository contains Code for the manuscript “Compact Ultra-Wide-Stopband Microwave Bandpass Filter with Multiple Transmission Zeros by Integrating an L-Shaped Bandpass Filter and a Stepped Impedance Lowpass Filter” published in IEEE Latin America Transactions.
Instruction for running the simulation:
Use HFSS to run “UWSB Bandpass Filter.py,” design the UWSB Bandpass Filter, and reproduce the results. 
1.	UWSB Bandpass Filter.py:In this file, the UWSB BPF simulation codes are included.
2.	S-Parameters results.txt: In this file, the S-parameter results are included.
3.	Graphical Abstract.png: In this file, the graphical abstract is included.
